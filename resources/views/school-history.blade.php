                <p>A welfare society started 20 years ago by an airforce wife to give back to society, has emerged today as an outstanding example of what seva bhaav can achieve.Radico Welfare Centre founded by Romil Sethi in 1999 to help in the development of  economically weaker individuals, is today, a school and centre that helps marginalised children from ages 3 years and upwards to find their feet and bloom. It is a non-government, not-for-profit organization focused on providing integrated educational, remedial and development support with special emphasis on the nurturing  women and children. </p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>In 1992 the society managed a welfare centre in Dayal Singh Colony (a basti next to Friend's Colony, New Delhi) which included a creche for children, sewing classes, adult literacy classes and a youth club for the local community. It also conducted eye and health camps within its ambit. However, it was in 1999 the Mrs Romil Sethi, with the support of the Urban Slum Development Board, established the Radico Welfare School in Kalkaji, extending the scope of her society as well as it's contributing role.
                    What started out as a primary school for children between the ages of 3 to 12 years, supports the community today through the mahila mandal and sewing classes. It  also reinforces the alumni of the school through their secondary school education with financial assistance and remedial classes. After years of selfless and untiring service towards bettering the future of the indigent, Mrs Sethi had to step back due to advancing Alzheimer' disease. 

This has been a labour of deep gentle love and unwavering faith in the belief that every child, every individual needs equal opportunity and attention to realise their true potential. Recognising Mrs Sethi's enormous  contribution in changing lives no less, the society was renamed after its tremendous founder as the Romil Seva Sansthan in 2018 and the school rechristened as Monsoon Kids. Truly a shower that continues to sustain and provide, just as it's towering founder wishes.</p>
