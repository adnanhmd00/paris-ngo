                    By making children resilient and socially responsible, through a well-curated education programme, we
                    create a ripple effect of change among the stakeholders. Children effect a change at the grassroots
                    level by helping their community aspire for a better and more well-inofrmed life.
                    The success of any programme is rooted in the triangualtion between parents, students and staff which
                    helps accelerate learning thus creating an impact that is sustainable and transformational.
