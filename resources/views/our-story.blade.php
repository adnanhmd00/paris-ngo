                    <p>In 1992, a young but aspiring and dynamic lady who lived in Delhi set out to make a difference. She
                        rounded up a group of like-minded people and set up a voluntary organisation by the name of ”Radico
                        Welfare Centre”.</p>
                    <p>
                        Since then the society has grown in both scale and reach, and most recently has been renamed Romil
                        Sewa Sanstha in tribute to Mrs. Romil Sethi for her relentless and selfless dedication and service
                        to the organization and the community it impacts.
                    </p>

                    <p>The primary aim of the organisation at its inception was to contribute to the welfare of the socially
                        and economically deprived and marginalised families living in the surrounding bastis. The goal was
                        to set up a friendly, non-governmental, social service centre that would provide remedial and
                        development services with a special emphasis on women and children </p>
                    <p>
                        The society has multifarious activities in order to meet the vision, including: preschool education
                        and care, primary education, remedial learning support, an alumni scholarship scheme, a nutritious
                        mid-day meal scheme, skill training and non-formal education for women, mahila mandal events, and
                        special assemblies on important days across all religions. </p>
